# Netflix-Movies-and-TV-shows-clustering
Using Unsupervised Machine learning models
Problem Statement

This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flexible which is a third- party Netflix search engine.
In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming service’s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

•	Exploratory Data Analysis
•	Understanding what type of content is available in different countries
•	Is Netflix increasingly focused on TV rather than movies in recent years?
•	Clustering similar content by matching text-based features

Our goal here is to make an unsupervised clustering model, which will help in garnering insights on Netflix and how its content is being consumed.


A brief summary of the dataset is given below:

Show id: Unique ID for every Movie / TV Show
type – Identifier - A Movie or TV Show title – Title of the Movie / TV Show director-director of the content
cast –Actors involved in the movie / show country – Country where the movie / show was produced
date_added – Date it was added on Netflix release_year – Actual Release year of the movie / show
rating – TV Rating of the movie / show duration – Total Duration - in minutes or number of seasons
listed_in – genre
description – The Summary description
